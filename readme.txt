This allows you to create a fan page like button that has none of the fancy stuff normally that exists: stream, profile thumbnail, name. Button only.

== Description ==

Want to boost your Facebook fan page subscription rate? This plugin makes what should be an easy task, but isn't, an easy one. It enables you to use a shortcode to place a small like button where ever you like without the clutter: stream, faces, count, and all of the other junk that comes with the "fan page like box" ordinarily. Basically, it generates a fan page subscription button that looks *identical* to the one ordinarily only for *sharing* a page (as opposed to actually subscribing).

= Features =

* Create a like button that resembles the one that normally *shares* the current page (*as opposed to subscribing to fan page*).
* Put the like button where ever you  want using the [facebooksimplelike] short code.
* Easily customize the simple border color.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Facebook fan page like button with the default white (#FFFFFF) iframe background, contrasting with the ordinary look of the Facebook "like box."
2. The settings/configuration page for Facebook Simple Like.
3. The profile pictures section of your facebook fan page, which is where you find the requisite "profile id" of your fan page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements for this plugin? =

A recent version of WordPress. The plugin doesn't do anything too fancy, so it probably runs on older versions too.

= Do you do WordPress consultation work? =

Absolutely! I'm a Zend Certified PHP 5.3 engineer, and can customize or create WordPress plugins and themes. Visit http://www.mdpatrick.com or email me (see support, below) for more details.

= Can I customize what is displayed? =

Yes, you can edit the facebook-simple-like.css file, but pay attention to the comments found within. The border color, however, can be and should be modified from the Settings page of the plugin.
